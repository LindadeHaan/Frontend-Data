# Process
### Week 1
#### Day 1 | November 12, 2018

We had an introduction of the new course: Frontend Data. We have to make a visualization of data from the OBA API and make it interactive.
After the introduction there was a guest speaker (Emma). She talked about datavisualizations and to show her work.

I searched for different data than the previous assignment to visualize.
I looked at examples of charts with interaction that are made with D3.

#### Day 2 | November 13, 2018

I thought of what data I want to visualize.

I want to visualize books with different languages, different genres, year of publication, publishers and the place where the books are published.

I'm thinking about using a bar chart or a sunburst, but I am not sure yet.

We had a stand-up organised by May. Everyone told what they think they want to visualize and what kind of chart they want to use. The other ones gave some tips or shared their thoughts about it.

I put my data in a `json` file.

I made sketches of the ideas I've got to visualize my data and how to make it interactive.

#### Day 3 | November 14, 2018

I told my idea to Laurens and got some feedback. The feedback helped a lot.

The guest speaker, Leon de Korte, had a very interesting talk about what they do at The Correspondent.

I made a map with `D3` with a tutorial and removed the countries I don't need.

I searched for a lot of turtorials about piecharts and maps.

#### Day 4 | November 15, 2018

* feedback die ik heb gehad (verder terug in de tijd)

Today I made a wireframe of my idea for the datavisualization.
I want to get the data from five languages and 6 genres and categorize them per language area in Europe.
I chose the five languages you can get at school: Dutch, English, German, French and Spanish. I only focus on Europe.

I already made a map with `D3`, but I need a pie chart first. Because I can make that interactive and than I can look at how I can get the pie charts on a map.
So I also tried to make pie charts, but I could not make it work.

At the end of the day we had to present our idea to the class.

#### Day 5 | November 16, 2018

Today I worked on getting a pie chart with my data. I could not make it work yet, but I don't have errors. So I don't know what I did wrong.
I want to figure this out during the weekend.

We had a workshop from Tim about `d3.nest`, he can explain really well and there were some things that were super interesting to learn.
And I learned a lot from the workshop Laurens gave about `d3Time`.
And there was a quick workshop about `slack` and `github` by Titus.

#### Day 6 | November 19, 2018

Guest speaker: Justus

I tried to make pie chart with D3 once again, but I could not make it work. So I changed my idea to a bar chart, because I understand this better.
I tried to make a stacked bar chart but I still do not understand it.

#### Day 7 | November 20, 2018

I still tried to make a stacked bar chart and I made a good start and finally understood how I can properly use `d3.nest` and the data I get from `d3.nest`.

The stacked bar chart did not work very well, so I'm going to try and make a grouped bar chart and maybe an anmination to a stacked bar chart.
