## Assignment üìö
Make a data visualization with interaction.

We had to make another data visualization with data we get from the OBA API. This time we had to add interaction to the visualization.

## First Idea üì∂
<img width="600" src="/images/wireframe-datavisualisatie.jpg">

I wanted to make a map with `D3` and on that map I wanted to place pie charts with the precentage of books with certain genres in a certain lanuage.
I chose five languages, Dutch, English, French, German and Spanish. I chose these languages, because these are the languages that you can learn or choose at school.  
I had the data from 2015 until 2018.

I also wanted the user to see information about the part of the pie charts when they would hover over it. You would see what the exact percentage was and how many books are exactly in that genre of a certain language.
And when there would be only one book, I wanted to show that exact book.

I started with making a map of Europe with `D3`. I did not want to have all the countries in Europe. I wanted to show all the areas in Europe where they speak Dutch, English, German, French or Spanish. For example in Luxembourg they speak German, French and Luxembourgs.
Finally I got the map. The map in the image above is the map I made with `D3`.

After I got the map I tried to make pie charts. I searched for a lot of tutorials and examples and tried out a lot of them. Everyday of the first week, after I got my idea, I tried to make a pie chart.  
But it just did not work.

But I had another idea, so I thought maybe I should give that a try.

## Second Idea üì∂

The second idea I had was a stacked bar chart where you could click on one of the stacked bars. And when you click one bar you would get a normal bar chart where you see all the parts of the stack bar. You could choose a language and you would see a stacked bar for every year and in the stack bar the genres would have been shown.

I had trouble with understanding how I must use the data I got. So in the beginning I could not make the stacked bar chart work. I struggled with that a lot, so I decided I have to reduce the data I got. So I got rid of the idea that I should show the years, but I still got the data from the year 2015 until 2018.
I still tried to make a stacked bar chart with the reduced data. I thought I was succeeding, but this wasn't the case. I had the right axis but the stacks did not work and one of the genres was grouped.

<img width="600" src="/images/stackedchart.png">

After this did not work out, I searched for an example for a grouped bar chart. I thought maybe that would be a bit easier to understand. And all the examples I found were indeed easier to understand, so I tried to make a grouped bar chart. In the beginning it would not really work, but after I asked help a couple of time from Wouter, Maikel, Chelsea and Jessie I eventually got a grouped bar chart (on the last day).

It was certainly not the idea I had in mind, but I'm still happy with the result. And I'm happy because I learned a lot about `D3` and I truly have the feeling I understand it pretty well.

In the chart I eventually made you see all the genres on the x axis and the percentage of books on the y axis.  
Each of the bars represent a language for each genre. They show the percentage of the amount of books in a certain language per genre.
You can change if you want to see all the languages or if you want to see one of the languages.

## Data üíæ
For the data I chose five languages I wanted to get from the API and six genres from the year 2015 until 2018.
I tried to get 1000 result for every genre. At first it crashed every time, because everyone in the course was getting data from the API.  
I tried to get all the data when I was home and it worked.

I got the feedback that I should get the data from earlier years, and I wanted to do that but I first wanted to get a working chart. I did this because I knew I was going to have trouble with the chart and I already had data. Eventually I did not have the time to get data from earlier years, because I got stuck with all the charts.

The data I got from the API:
* The languages Dutch, English, German, French and Spanish;
* Publication years from 2015 until 2018;
* The genres Detective, Humor, Sciencefiction, Stripverhaal, Avontureroman and Romantisch verhaal;
* Publication place, because I had a little idea to show this when you would hover on a genre with a few books.

## Interaction ‚ÅâÔ∏è
I got very few interactions, but I had such a struggle with getting a chart. I am happy with what I've got.

The interactions I've got are:
* Switching the language you can see;
* Hover over the bars and get a tooltip with the language, genre and the exact percentage of that bar.

## What did I learn? ü§î
Getting the data I needed wasn't a problem, because I had done this before now (in the last course). So that was something that I got pretty quick.  

I really learned a lot about `D3`. Although did not use `d3.nest()` in my final product, I did use it to make the other bar and pie charts. I learned how useful it is to give you data a different structure, so you can use it how you want to use it.

I learned that `D3` is a lot of math, that is what makes it logical. And I understand math pretty well, that is why I understand `D3` more than I understand `JavaScript`.

You can make so many different visualizations with the same data with `D3`. I just could not make it work, because I did not understand how to use my data at first. But eventually I understood it, luckily!.

I got a lot of help from other students. They helped to understand the code and helped me understand how I should use the code.

Jessie helped me a lot with all the errors I got and also with a lot of code about `d3.nest()`.

Wouter and Maikel especially helped me with understanding my code and understanding how to use it.

Chelsea explained a lot of code to me. She is really good at explaining code I just do not understand fully.

Guus helped me with the transition of the bars. He gave one tip and after that it immediately worked.

<!-- # Process
### Week 1
#### Day 1 | November 12, 2018

We had an introduction of the new course: Frontend Data. We have to make a visualization of data from the OBA API and make it interactive.
After the introduction there was a guest speaker (Emma). She talked about datavisualizations and to show her work.

I searched for different data than the previous assignment to visualize.
I looked at examples of charts with interaction that are made with D3.

#### Day 2 | November 13, 2018

I thought of what data I want to visualize.

I want to visualize books with different languages, different genres, year of publication, publishers and the place where the books are published.

I'm thinking about using a bar chart or a sunburst, but I am not sure yet.

We had a stand-up organised by May. Everyone told what they think they want to visualize and what kind of chart they want to use. The other ones gave some tips or shared their thoughts about it.

I put my data in a `json` file.

I made sketches of the ideas I've got to visualize my data and how to make it interactive.

#### Day 3 | November 14, 2018

I told my idea to Laurens and got some feedback. The feedback helped a lot.

The guest speaker, Leon de Korte, had a very interesting talk about what they do at The Correspondent.

I made a map with `D3` with a tutorial and removed the countries I don't need.

I searched for a lot of turtorials about piecharts and maps.

#### Day 4 | November 15, 2018

* feedback die ik heb gehad (verder terug in de tijd)

Today I made a wireframe of my idea for the datavisualization.
I want to get the data from five languages and 6 genres and categorize them per language area in Europe.
I chose the five languages you can get at school: Dutch, English, German, French and Spanish. I only focus on Europe.

I already made a map with `D3`, but I need a pie chart first. Because I can make that interactive and than I can look at how I can get the pie charts on a map.
So I also tried to make pie charts, but I could not make it work.

At the end of the day we had to present our idea to the class.

#### Day 5 | November 16, 2018

Today I worked on getting a pie chart with my data. I could not make it work yet, but I don't have errors. So I don't know what I did wrong.
I want to figure this out during the weekend.

We had a workshop from Tim about `d3.nest`, he can explain really well and there were some things that were super interesting to learn.
And I learned a lot from the workshop Laurens gave about `d3Time`.
And there was a quick workshop about `slack` and `github` by Titus.

#### Day 6 | November 19, 2018

Guest speaker: Justus

I tried to make pie chart with D3 once again, but I could not make it work. So I changed my idea to a bar chart, because I understand this better.
I tried to make a stacked bar chart but I still do not understand it.

#### Day 7 | November 20, 2018

I still tried to make a stacked bar chart and I made a good start and finally understood how I can properly use `d3.nest` and the data I get from `d3.nest`.

The stacked bar chart did not work very well, so I'm going to try and make a grouped bar chart and maybe an anmination to a stacked bar chart. -->
