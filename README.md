# D3

## Assignment
Make a data visualization with interaction.

# Process
### Week 1
#### Day 1 | November 12, 2018

We had an introduction of the new course: Frontend Data. We have to make a visualization of data from the OBA API and make it interactive.
After the introduction there was a guest speaker (Emma). She talked about datavisualizations and to show her work.

I searched for different data than the previous assignment to visualize.
I looked at examples of charts with interaction that are made with D3.

#### Day 2 | November 13, 2018

I thought of what data I want to visualize.

I want to visualize books with different languages, different genres, year of publication, publishers and the place where the books are published.

I'm thinking about using a bar chart or a sunburst, but I am not sure yet.

We had a stand-up organised by May. Everyone told what they think they want to visualize and what kind of chart they want to use. The other ones gave some tips or shared their thoughts about it.

I put my data in a `json` file.

I made sketches of the ideas I've got to visualize my data and how to make it interactive.
